# The summary explanations about Microsoft Azure Fabric components & Build Artifacts

## Microsoft Azure Fabric components

| Component | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Workspaces** | The container for all your data resources, providing a unified environment for managing data, analytics, and AI workloads. |
| **Lakehouse** | Combines the storage abilities of data lakes with the organizational features of data warehouses, enabling both structured and unstructured data storage and management. |
| **Data Factory** | A cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and orchestrate Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) workflows to move and transform data from various sources. |
| **Synapse Engineering** | Provides a unified experience for big data and data warehousing, allowing you to transform data using Apache Spark, SQL, and Notebooks within Azure Synapse Analytics. |
| **Data Warehouse** | A centralized repository for structured data, optimized for fast query performance and analytics, often part of Azure Synapse Analytics. |
| **Power BI** | A business analytics service that enables you to visualize and report on data, creating interactive dashboards and reports. |
| **Real-Time Analytics** | The capability to analyze data as it streams in, enabling real-time insights and decision-making. |
| **Data Science** | The practice of using statistical methods, algorithms, and models to derive insights from data, often involving machine learning and AI tools within Azure Machine Learning. |
